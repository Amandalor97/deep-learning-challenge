# MODULE 21: deep-learning-challenge

Goal: Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


# DATA PREPROCESSING: 

<ins>- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?<ins>

Binary success rate (Yes/No). We looked at the column 'IS _SUCCESSFUL', 1 is successful, 0 is unsuccessful. 

<ins>- What variable(s) are the features for your model?<ins>

<ins>- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?<ins>
  

# COMPILING, TRAINING, AND EVALUATING THE MODEL

<ins>- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?<ins>

<ins>- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?<ins>

<ins>- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?<ins>
