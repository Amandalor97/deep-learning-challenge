# MODULE 21: deep-learning-challenge

Goal: Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


#DATA PREPROCESSING: 

- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are the features for your model?

- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  

#COMPILING, TRAINING, AND EVALUATING THE MODEL

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?


#SUMMARY:
