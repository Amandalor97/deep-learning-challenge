# MODULE 21: deep-learning-challenge

Goal: Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


# DATA PREPROCESSING: 

<ins>- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?<ins>

Binary success rate (Yes/No). We looked at the column 'IS _SUCCESSFUL', 1 is successful, 0 is unsuccessful. 

![IS_SUCCESSFUL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0046000-c12d-4196-a5c2-d244b7c98780)


<ins>- What variable(s) are the features for your model?<ins>

The variables which are the features for our model are: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION,	USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION,	STATUS,	INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT. 
They can be found in the application_df.

<ins>- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?<ins>
  

# COMPILING, TRAINING, AND EVALUATING THE MODEL

<ins>- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?<ins>

<ins>- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?<ins>

<ins>- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?<ins>
